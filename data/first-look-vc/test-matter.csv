With the decline of RSS and the death of services like Google Reader, Roost fills a vacuum for readers who want to stay engaged with their favorite websites. Roost enables readers to receive up to the minute, light touch reminders whenever their preferred web publishers post new content, but without crowding their inbox or overwhelming them with heavy messaging.

Roost, in turn, allows web publishers to identify their most loyal readers and consistently create new interactions with them. Apart from Roost, desktop push notifications are too cost and resource prohibitive for publishers to integrate with their websites. Roost solves this problem.

With the emergence of mobile apps, push notifications quickly became the preferred method of content consumption within apps. Roost is applying this communication channel to the web.

Founded in 2009 as Notice Software , Roost began to earnestly pursue mobile web push in 2012.

For authors today, creating digital versions of their books is both a costly and timely process. The options to create visually compelling, cross-platform storybooks requires either well-honed programming skills or the funding necessary to hire expensive developers to create these applications.

Authorly founder Chris Whitman was one of these developers. After being hired by New York Times Bestselling author Carl Sams to convert the popular children's book Stranger in the Woods into an interactive app, he decided there must be an easier way. Whitman therefore began to build disruptive software that empowers authors to create their own apps. The result is Authorly: a platform perfect for childrenâ€™s authors, comic book artists, visual novelists, or anyone with a great illustrated story to tell. 

Authorly enables artists to create digital storybook applications through an intuitive web-based platform. Our proprietary technology takes care of the tedious aspects of app production, like adjusting each story to fit a multitude of smartphones and tablets and publishing them to iTunes, the Google Play, and the Amazon Appstore. Some of the features authors can add to their apps include basic animations, sound effects, embedded videos, automatically aligned word-by-word voice narration,  panning and zooming, and animated hotspot technology.

Community Elf (www.communityelf.com) launches this month as the social media solution for businesses overburdened with the hassles of managing their own profiles. As managing social media platforms can be a difficult and time consuming factor for businesses, Community Elf streamlines the process to let professionals get back to work. Community Elf is a technology driven firm that generates leads and sales by focusing on four main features: creating and customizing Facebook, Twitter, and Blog pages to reflect corporate branding; creating engaging content to keep profile pages up to date with an informed community; monitoring for comments and spam; and submitting content to search engines for search engine optimization (SEO). Community Elf is a fully outsourced, inexpensive social media managing firm that offers new technologies to efficiently manage profiles.

Community Elf creates Facebook, Twitter, and Blogger profiles complete with a consistent theme to match company branding. Using unique data mining technologies, Community Elf additionally offers Customized Facebook Applications to draw attention to profiles to help pull in leads and traffic. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“Welcome TabÃ¢â‚¬ offers a well-manicured and professional description of the company, along with logos and links back to the main site. Community Elf also manages postings on the profiles by generating content, posting client provided content, and by monitoring the company website for updates.

Community Elf posts are generated by a team of dedicated representatives who create professional posts in the voice and diction of their clients. Each client receives an individual representative who handles postings, checks in for weekly updates, and ensures customers are satisfied. In addition to profile management, Community Elf representatives manage a companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reputation by monitoring their profiles for spam and malicious comments. Any unwanted posts are immediately deleted and reported to the clients, allowing clients to assess and handle the situation as necessary. 

Community ElfÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s services are available in three main customizable packages ranging from light social media interaction to comprehensive engagement. Packages affordably begin at $120 per month and come with guaranteed posting services, no matter the package.

As a result, hyperlinks become transparent and personalized and bring high-value content to the userâ€™s immediate attention. Users also gain better control over the content they see, while avoiding clickbait and repetitive information.

Users get immediate value from the content behind the link without expending any effort, and they discover related content that is also personalized down to the snippet.
